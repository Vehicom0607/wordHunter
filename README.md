# Details
I'll likely write a blog post eventually(emphasis on the eventually) detailing the exact technical details.
The current pipeline involves a calibration image to find the board, use of OpenCV and Google Tesseract OCV for board detection, a DFS(Depth First Search) algorithm, and a greedy(-ish?) algorithm(by word length) for path planning, and GCode for interfacing with the repurposed drawing machine.
